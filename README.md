The primary aim of this project is to create a Speaker Recognition system that can accurately 
differentiate between different speakers by analyzing their distinctive voice traits. To achieve this, we 
will employ sophisticated machine-learning techniques and a varied collection of audio recordings. 
Our focus is on achieving a high level of precision in speaker identification tasks in a range of real-world situations. We will conduct extensive training and testing to contribute to the advancement of 
Speaker Recognition technology for practical use in security, telecommunications, and personalized 
user experiences #
