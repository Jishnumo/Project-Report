The primary aim of this project is to create a Speaker Recognition system that can accurately 
differentiate between different speakers by analyzing their distinctive voice traits. To achieve this, we 
will employ sophisticated machine-learning techniques and a varied collection of audio recordings. 
Our focus is on achieving a high level of precision in speaker identification tasks in a range of real-world situations. We plan to undertake comprehensive training and testing processes to contribute to the progress of Speaker Recognition technology, aiming for its practical application in security, telecommunications, and personalized user experiences.
